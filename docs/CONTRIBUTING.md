## Development

You can contribute to this project by forking it from GitHub and sending pull requests.

First [fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) the
[repository](https://github.com/SpokaneTech/SpokaneTech_Py) and then clone it:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<you>/SpokaneTech_Py.git
```

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```shell
cd SpokaneTech_Py
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.dev.lock
```

> Note: to add a new dependency see [Adding Dependencies](#adding-dependencies).

`python-dotenv` will automatically load values in the `.env` file when Django's `manage.py` is used. Create a `.env` file from the template (**note: `.env` should never be checked in to source control!**):

```shell
cp .env.template .env
```

Run Django migrations:
```shell
cd src
python manage.py migrate
```

Create a Django superuser:
```shell
cd src
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Run the Django development web server locally:
```shell
cd src
python manage.py runserver
```

Unit tests are located in each Django app under the tests directory and can be executed via pytest:

```shell
pytest
```

### Adding Dependencies

The lock files are generated using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv);
which is included in the development requirements. To add a file use:

```shell
uv add [--dev] SOME-DEP
uv pip compile pyproject.toml --extra dev -o requirements.dev.lock --prerelease=allow
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock --prerelease=allow
```

Then make sure to sync the virtual environment with the new lock files.

```shell
uv pip sync requirements.dev.lock
```

### Dagger

[Dagger](https://dagger.io/) is used for continuous integration and 
provides a dev environment with a Celery, Redis, and Postgres instances.

To run Dagger locally you will need:

- [The Dagger CLI](https://docs.dagger.io/install)
- [The Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)


To run all linters at once:
```shell
dagger call linters all
```

To spin up a dev environment use:
```shell
dagger call up
```

This command:

- Spins up the Django Server, Redis, Postgres, and Celery
- Creates a Django admin with username/password `dagger`/`dagger`
- Tunnels the Django server to [localhost:8000]()

The Postgres database is mounted as a cache volume, so its state will persist between runs. 
To wipe the database, pass the `--fresh-database`.


<details>
<summary>More Details</summary>

To list available functions use:
```shell
dagger functions
```

Then, to call the functions use:

```shell
dagger call FUNCTION-NAME FUNCTION-ARGS
```

To gather more information about a function, you can pass the `--help` arg to it:

```shell
$ dagger call linters test --help
Run tests using Pytest.

Usage:
  dagger call linters test [flags]

Flags:
      --dev-req File     A file.
      --pyproject File   A file.

Global Flags:
      --debug             Show more information for debugging
      --focus             Only show output for focused commands (default true)
      --json              Present result as JSON
  -m, --mod string        Path to dagger.json config file for the module
                          or a directory containing that file. Either
                          local path (e.g. "/path/to/some/dir") or a
                          github repo (e.g.
                          "github.com/dagger/dagger/path/to/some/subdir")
  -o, --output string     Path in the host to save the result to
      --progress string   progress output format (auto, plain, tty)
                          (default "auto")
  -s, --silent            disable terminal UI and progress output
```

For functions that return a `Container` - like `dev` - addtional commands can
be chained on that will act on that container. For example, the following
command transforms the development container into a service, and starts it.

```shell
dagger call up
```
</details>

### Contributing to CI

When contributing to the CI it can be useful to install the SDK for
autocomplete and linting. Plus, this enables type hints for third party
modules, not just the first party Dagger SDK. Inside your virtual environment,
run the following commands:

```shell
dagger develop # Generates the SDK
pip install -e ./dagger/sdk
```

Dagger has an in-depth [Developing with
Python](https://docs.dagger.io/manuals/developer/python) guide, and the Python
SDK referance is [here](https://dagger-io.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

### Celery


The easiest way to run Celery is using the Dagger development environment described above. 

To run Celery manually you will need to start a message broker and a Celery
worker. We are using redis for our message broker. Make sure you have
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and run the following
docker command to start a redis container:

```shell
docker run -t -p 6379:6379 redis:7.2
```

In a separate terminal, run the Celery worker:

```shell
python -m celery --workdir ./src -A spokanetech.celery worker -B -l INFO
```

After running the Celery worker, you should see periodic tasks show in the [Django admin UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/django_celery_beat/periodictask/):

```shell
cd src
python manage.py runserver # (1)!
```

1.  Then navigate to the [Django admin UI](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/django_celery_beat/periodictask/)

Refer to our [Celery docs](./celery.md) for more information on how Celery works.

## Docs

When updating the docs locally, run the mkdocs server with `mkdocs serve`.

You can also build the docs with `mkdocs build`.
